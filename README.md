## A Note on AI Collaboration

This project represents a modern development paradigm, pairing human architectural vision with AI-driven implementation. I provided the core logic, architectural design, and iterative feedback that shaped the final product.

The majority of the boilerplate and implementation code was generated by Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro, acting under direct and specific instruction from the developer. This collaborative process allowed for rapid prototyping and the exploration of multiple complex architectures—from filesystem watching to symbolic linking to the final, robust environment virtualization model—in a fraction of the time traditional development would take. This README was also drafted by Gemini based on the final codebase and project goals defined by me.

## Description

**PiratedHollowKnight** is more than just a launcher; it is a sophisticated tool designed to enhance the Hollow Knight experience for technical users. It provides seamless, multi-instance gameplay without save file collisions and automates the entire installation and dependency management process.

At its core, it solves the problem of running multiple, simultaneous instances of the game by virtualizing the save environment for each process, while also providing robust, live backup capabilities to local or cloud storage.

## Core Features

### 1. Dynamic Save Synchronization Modes

The launcher intelligently adapts its behavior based on the targets you provide, eliminating the old "first-target-is-master" rule.

-   **Latest-Source-Wins Mode:** When you provide a mix of local and cloud targets, the launcher checks the modification time of every save location. It automatically identifies the most recently played save file and uses it as the master source for the game session, ensuring you always continue from your latest progress, no matter where it was saved.
-   **Online-Only Mode:** If you provide *only* cloud-based targets (e.g., `gdrive:`), the launcher runs in a direct mode. It compares your local saves with the cloud saves, syncs down the newest version if necessary, and then runs the game directly on your main save files without creating a temporary environment. After you quit, it syncs your progress back up to the cloud.

### 2. Automatic Game Installation
- If the game is not found, the launcher will automatically download it from `buzzheavier.com`.
- **Integrity Guarantee:** A SHA-1 hash (`edf6dbde9a65a6304e096b61b0b2226a6e8a2416`) verifies the download, protecting against corruption.
- **Resilient Downloads:** Can be configured to automatically retry failed downloads.

### 3. Multi-Instance Save Isolation
- **Per-Process Virtualization:** Before launching, a unique temporary directory is created for that instance.
- **Environment Modification:** The game process starts with a modified `USERPROFILE` environment variable, transparently redirecting all save I/O to its own isolated sandbox. This ensures multiple instances can run simultaneously without any save file collisions. (Note: This mode is used when at least one local target is specified).

### 4. Automated & Portable Dependency Management
- **Self-Contained Rclone:** If `rclone.exe` is not found, the launcher automatically downloads it.
- **Automatic Portable Rclone Configuration:** If you use a Google Drive target and no configuration is found, the launcher will **automatically start the interactive `rclone` setup wizard** for a one-time setup. The configuration is saved locally to `rclone.conf`, making the entire tool portable.
- **Extractor Requirement:** Relies on an existing `7-Zip` or `WinRAR` installation.

### 5. Cleanup Utility
- The `clean` command uninstalls all managed components: the Hollow Knight game installation and the downloaded `rclone.exe`.

## Usage

This is a command-line utility. Open a terminal (CMD, PowerShell, etc.) in the directory containing the executable.

### First-Time Google Drive Setup
The setup is automatic. Simply run the launcher with a Google Drive target for the first time. The official `rclone` setup wizard will start. Follow the on-screen instructions. This only needs to be done once.
```sh
# This will trigger the setup wizard automatically
.\PiratedHollowKnight.exe --target="gdrive:YourFolderID" --log-level=info
```

### Basic Launch```sh
# Launch the game without save management (no output on success)
.\PiratedHollowKnight.exe
```

### Advanced Launch with Cloud Backups
```sh
# Use a local master save, with a live backup to Google Drive.
# The launcher will automatically detect which save is newer and start from there.
.\PiratedHollowKnight.exe --target="D:\HollowKnightSaves" --target="gdrive:YourFolderID|0|true" --log-level=info
```

## Full Command Reference

**Commands:**
- `(no command)`: Runs the default launch sequence.
- `clean`: Deletes the downloaded game and rclone executable.

**Flags:**
- `--target="path[|interval|quit_sync]"`: (Repeatable) Specifies a save location. The first target is always the primary.
- `--install-path="path"`: (Optional) The directory where Hollow Knight should be installed.
- `--config-path="path"`: (Optional) Path to the `rclone.conf` file. Defaults to `rclone.conf` in the executable's directory.
- `--log-level="level"`: (Optional) Set logging verbosity. Options: `info`, `warn`, `error`, `quiet`. Defaults to `quiet`.
- `--auth`: (Optional) Force the `rclone` authentication wizard to run, even if a configuration already exists. Useful for re-authenticating or adding new remotes.
- `--sync-on-quit`: (Optional) A global flag to enable syncing on quit for backup targets.
- `--download-retries[=N]`: (Optional) Number of times to retry the download. Defaults to 1. If the flag is provided without a number (e.g., `--download-retries`), it will retry indefinitely.
