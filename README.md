## A Note on AI Collaboration

This project represents a modern development paradigm, pairing human architectural vision with AI-driven implementation. I provided the core logic, architectural design, and iterative feedback that shaped the final product.

The majority of the boilerplate and implementation code was generated by Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro, acting under direct and specific instruction from the developer. This collaborative process allowed for rapid prototyping and the exploration of multiple complex architectures—from filesystem watching to symbolic linking to the final, robust environment virtualization model—in a fraction of the time traditional development would take. This README was also drafted by Gemini based on the final codebase and project goals defined by me.

## Description

**PiratedHollowKnight** is more than just a launcher; it is a sophisticated tool designed to enhance the Hollow Knight experience for technical users. It provides seamless, multi-instance gameplay without save file collisions and automates the entire installation and dependency management process.

At its core, it solves the problem of running multiple, simultaneous instances of the game by virtualizing the save environment for each process, while also providing robust, live backup capabilities to local or cloud storage.

## Core Features

### 1. Automatic Game Installation
- If the game is not found, the launcher will automatically download it from `buzzheavier.com`.
- **Integrity Guarantee:** A SHA-1 hash (`edf6dbde9a65a6304e096b61b0b2226a6e8a2416`) verifies the download, protecting against corruption.
- **Resilient Downloads:** Can be configured to automatically retry failed downloads.

### 2. Multi-Instance Save Isolation
- **Per-Process Virtualization:** Before launching, a unique temporary directory is created for that instance.
- **Environment Modification:** The game process starts with a modified `USERPROFILE` environment variable, transparently redirecting all save I/O to its own isolated sandbox. This ensures multiple instances can run simultaneously without any save file collisions.

### 3. Advanced Save Management & Backups
- **Live Primary Save:** The first `--target` is the master save location. The game session runs directly on these saves in an isolated environment.
- **Live & Periodic Backups:** Subsequent `--target` locations act as backups, syncing automatically from the live session.
- **Native Google Drive Versioning:** Uses `rclone copy` to leverage Google Drive's native file versioning, creating a new version on every upload instead of overwriting.

### 4. Automated & Portable Dependency Management
- **Self-Contained Rclone:** If `rclone.exe` is not found, the launcher automatically downloads it.
- **Automatic Portable Rclone Configuration:** If you use a Google Drive target and no configuration is found, the launcher will **automatically start the interactive `rclone` setup wizard** for a one-time setup. The configuration is saved locally to `rclone.conf`, making the entire tool portable.
- **Extractor Requirement:** Relies on an existing `7-Zip` or `WinRAR` installation.

### 5. Cleanup Utility
- The `clean` command uninstalls all managed components: the Hollow Knight game installation and the downloaded `rclone.exe`.

## Usage

This is a command-line utility. Open a terminal (CMD, PowerShell, etc.) in the directory containing the executable.

### First-Time Google Drive Setup
The setup is automatic. Simply run the launcher with a Google Drive target for the first time. The official `rclone` setup wizard will start. Follow the on-screen instructions. This only needs to be done once.
```sh
# This will trigger the setup wizard automatically
.\PiratedHollowKnight.exe --target="gdrive:YourFolderID" --log-level=info
```

### Basic Launch
```sh
# Launch the game without save management (no output on success)
.\PiratedHollowKnight.exe
```

### Advanced Launch with Cloud Backups
```sh
# Use a local master save, with a live backup to Google Drive and
# a periodic 600-second (10-minute) backup to another local folder.
# Use --log-level=info to see detailed operation status.
.\PiratedHollowKnight.exe --target="D:\HollowKnightSaves" --target="gdrive:YourFolderID|0|true" --target="E:\Backups|600" --log-level=info
```
